The defaults are listed below:\r\n\r\n\tvar options = {\r\n\t\tcert: 'cert.pem',                 /* Certificate file path */\r\n\t\tcertData: null,                   /* String or Buffer containing certificate data, if supplied uses this instead of cert file path */\r\n\t\tkey:  'key.pem',                  /* Key file path */\r\n\t\tkeyData: null,                    /* String or Buffer containing key data, as certData */\r\n\t\tpassphrase: null,                 /* A passphrase for the Key file */\r\n\t\tca: null\t\t\t\t\t\t  /* String or Buffer of CA data to use for the TLS connection */\r\n\t\tgateway: 'gateway.push.apple.com',/* gateway address */\r\n\t\tport: 2195,                       /* gateway port */\r\n\t\tenhanced: true,                   /* enable enhanced format */\r\n\t\terrorCallback: undefined,         /* Callback when error occurs function(err,notification) */\r\n\t\tcacheLength: 100                  /* Number of notifications to cache for error purposes */\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\tvar apnsConnection = new apns.Connection(options);\r\n\t\r\n**Important:** In a development environment you must set `gateway` to `gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com`.\r\n\r\n### Sending a notification\r\nTo send a notification first create a `Device` object. Pass it the device token as either a hexadecimal string, or alternatively as a `Buffer` object containing the token in binary form.\r\n\r\n\tvar myDevice = new apns.Device(token);\r\n\r\nNext, create a notification object and set parameters. See the [payload documentation][pl] for more details.\r\n\r\n\tvar note = new apns.Notification();\r\n\t\r\n\tnote.expiry = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 3600; // Expires 1 hour from now.\r\n\tnote.badge = 3;\r\n\tnote.sound = \"ping.aiff\";\r\n\tnote.alert = \"You have a new message\";\r\n\tnote.payload = {'messageFrom': 'Caroline'};\r\n\tnote.device = myDevice;\r\n\t\r\n\tapnsConnection.sendNotification(note);\r\n\t\r\nAs of version 1.2.0 it is also possible to use a set of methods provided by Notification object (`setAlertText`, `setActionLocKey`, `setLocKey`, `setLocArgs`, `setLaunchImage`) to aid the creation of the alert parameters. For applications which provide Newsstand capability there is a new boolean parameter `note.newsstandAvailable` to specify `content-available` in the payload.\r\n\r\nThe above options will compile the following dictionary to send to the device:\r\n\r\n\t{\"messageFrom\":\"Caroline\",\"aps\":{\"badge\":3,\"sound\":\"ping.aiff\",\"alert\":\"You have a new message\"}}\r\n\t\r\n**\\*N.B.:** If you wish to send notifications containing emoji or other multi-byte characters you will need to set `note.encoding = 'ucs2'`. This tells node to send the message with 16bit characters, however it also means your message payload will be limited to 127 characters.\r\n\t\r\n### Handling Errors\r\n\r\nIf the enhanced binary interface is enabled and an error occurs - as defined in Apple's documentation - when sending a message, then subsequent messages will be automatically resent* and the connection will be re-established. If an `errorCallback` is also specified in the connection options then it will be invoked with 2 arguments `(err, notification)`\r\n\r\nIf a notification fails to be sent because a connection error occurs then the `errorCallback` will be called for each notification waiting for the connection which failed. In this case the first parameter will be an Error object instead of an error number.\r\n\r\n`errorCallback` will be called in 3 situations with the parameters shown.\r\n\r\n1. The notification has been rejected by Apple (or determined to have an invalid device token or payload before sending) for one of the reasons shown in Table 5-1 [here][errors] `errorCallback(errorCode, notification)`\r\n1. A notification has been rejected by Apple but it has been removed from the cache so it is not possible to identify which. In this case subsequent notifications may be lost. **If this happens you should consider increasing your `cacheLength` value to prevent data loss** `errorCallback(255, null)`\r\n1. A connection error has occurred before the notification can be sent. `errorCallback(Error object, notification)`\r\n\r\n**\\*N.B.:** The `cacheLength` option for the connection specifies the number of sent notifications which will be cached, on a FIFO basis for error handling purposes. If `cacheLength` is not set to a large enough value, then in high volume environments, a notification - possibly including some subsequent notifications - may be removed from the cache before Apple returns an error associated with it. In this case the `errorCallback` will still be called, but with a `null` notification and error code 255. If this happens you should consider increasing `cacheLength` to prevent losing notifications. All the notifications still residing in the cache will be resent automatically.\r\n\r\n### Setting up the feedback service\r\n\r\nApple recommends checking the feedback service periodically for a list of devices for which there were failed delivery attempts.\r\n\r\nUsing the `Feedback` object it is possible to periodically query the server for the list. You should provide a function `feedback` which will accept two arguments, the `time` returned by the server (epoch time) and a `Buffer` object containing the device token. You can also set the query interval in seconds. The default options are shown below.\r\n\r\n\tvar options = {\r\n\t\tcert: 'cert.pem',                   /* Certificate file */\r\n\t\tcertData: null,                     /* Certificate file contents (String|Buffer) */\r\n\t\tkey:  'key.pem',                    /* Key file */\r\n\t\tkeyData: null,                      /* Key file contents (String|Buffer) */\r\n\t\tpassphrase: null,                   /* A passphrase for the Key file */\r\n\t\tca: null,\t\t\t\t\t\t\t/* Certificate authority data to pass to the TLS connection */\r\n\t\taddress: 'feedback.push.apple.com', /* feedback address */\r\n\t\tport: 2196,                         /* feedback port */\r\n\t\tfeedback: false,                    /* enable feedback service, set to callback */\r\n\t\tinterval: 3600                      /* interval in seconds to connect to feedback service */\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\tvar feedback = new apns.Feedback(options);\r\n\r\nThis will automatically start a timer to check with Apple every `interval` seconds. You can cancel the interval by calling `feedback.cancel()`. If you do not wish to have the service automatically queried then set `interval` to 0 and use `feedback.start()`.\r\n\r\n**Important:** In a development environment you must set `address` to `feedback.sandbox.push.apple.com`.\r\n\r\nMore information about the feedback service can be found in the [feedback service documentation][fs].\r\n\r\n## Converting your APNs Certificate\r\n\r\nAfter requesting the certificate from Apple, export your private key as a .p12 file and download the .cer file from the iOS Provisioning Portal.\r\n\r\nNow, in the directory containing cert.cer and key.p12 execute the following commands to generate your .pem files:\r\n\r\n\t$ openssl x509 -in cert.cer -inform DER -outform PEM -out cert.pem\r\n\t$ openssl pkcs12 -in key.p12 -out key.pem -nodes\r\n\t\r\nIf you are using a development certificate you may wish to name them differently to enable fast switching between development and production. The filenames are configurable within the module options, so feel free to name them something more appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nWritten and maintained by [Andrew Naylor][andrewnaylor].\r\n\r\nContributors: [Ian Babrou][bobrik], [dgthistle][dgthistle], [Keith Larsen][keithnlarsen], [Mike P][mypark], [Greg Bergé][neoziro]\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nReleased under the MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2010 Andrew Naylor\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
