#node-apn

A Node.js module for interfacing with the Apple Push Notification service.

## Features

- Maintains a connection to the server to maximise notification batching
- Enhanced binary interface support with error handling
- Automatically sends unsent notifications if an error occurs
- Feedback service support

## Installation

Via [npm][]:

	$ npm install apn
	
As a submodule of your project

	$ git submodule add http://github.com/argon/node-apn.git apn
	$ git submodule update --init

## Usage
### Load in the module

	var apns = require('apn');

### Exported Objects
- Connection
- Notification
- Device
- Feedback
- errors

### Connecting
Create a new connection to the gateway server using a dictionary of options. The defaults are listed below:

	var options = {
		cert: 'cert.pem',                 /* Certificate file */
		certData: null,                   /* Optional: if supplied uses this instead of Certificate File */
		key:  'key.pem',                  /* Key file */
		keyData: null,                    /* Optional: if supplied uses this instead of Key file */
		gateway: 'gateway.push.apple.com',/* gateway address */
		port: 2195,                       /* gateway port */
		enhanced: true,                   /* enable enhanced format */
		errorCallback: undefined,         /* Callback when error occurs */
		successCallback: undefined	  /* Callback when notification is sent */
		cacheLength: 5                    /* Number of notifications to cache for error purposes */
	};

	var apnsConnection = new apns.Connection(options);

### Sending a notification
To send a notification first create a `Device` object. Pass it the device token as either a hexadecimal string, or alternatively as a `Buffer` object containing the binary token, setting the second argument to `false`.

	var myDevice = new apns.Device(token /*, ascii=true*/);

Next create a notification object and set parameters. See the [payload documentation][pl] for more details

	var note = new apns.Notification();
	
	note.badge = 3;
	note.sound = "ping.aiff";
	note.alert = "You have a new message";
	note.payload = {'messageFrom': 'Caroline'};
	note.device = myDevice;
	
	apnsConnection.sendNotification(note);
	
The above options will compile the following dictionary to send to the device:

	{"messageFrom":"Caroline","aps":{"badge":3,"sound":"ping.aiff","alert":"You have a new message"}}
	
\* N.B.: If you wish to send notifications containing emoji or other multi-byte characters you will need to set `note.encoding = 'ucs2'`. This tells node to send the message with 16bit characters, however it also means your message payload will be limited to 127 characters.
	
### Handling Errors

If the enhanced binary interface is enabled and an error occurs when sending a message then subsequent messages will be automatically resent* and the connection will be re-established. If an `errorCallback` is also specified in the connection options then it will be invoked with 2 arguments.

1. The error number as returned from Apple. This can be compared to the predefined values in the `Errors` object.
1. The notification object as it existed when the notification was converted and sent to the server.



\* N.B.: The `cacheLength` option specifies the number of sent notifications which will be cached for error handling purposes. At present if more than the specified number of notifications have been sent between the incorrect notification being sent and the error being received then no resending will occur. This is only envisaged within very high volume environments and a higher cache number might be desired.

### Extended Options while sending

sendNotification can also take options as a second argument, which will override the one presented during the connection setup. This is well suited to web servers listening on an endpoint. When the server starts, create the apns connection with initial options. eg: for an express based app that responds to an endpoint when the notification is sent based on some query parameters:

                                                             /* an express app sets apnsConnection,options on startup */
        app.get('/:token', function(req,res){                /* an endpoint wants its success callback to send JSON   */
                var note;                                    /* create a note, set device based like in earler eg's   */
                var extendedOptions = _.extend(options,{     /* using a library like underscore.js to extend options  */
                        errorCallback: onError(req,res),     /* in this case, errors are handled seperately           */
                        successCallback: function(){         /* in its success, the request finally replies with JSON */
                            res.send({note:note,sent:true}); 
                        }
                });
                apnsConnection.sendNotification(note, extendedOptions);
                                                             /* each sendNotification can now have it's own options   */
        });


### Setting up the feedback service

Apple recommends checking the feedback service periodically for a list of devices for which there were failed delivery attempts.

Using the `Feedback` object it is possible to periodically query the server for the list. You should provide a function which will accept two arguments, the `time` returned by the server (epoch time) and a `Device` object containing the device token. You can also set the query interval in seconds. Again the default options are shown below.

	var options = {
		cert: 'cert.pem',                   /* Certificate file */
		certData: null,                     /* Certificate file contents */
		key:  'key.pem',                    /* Key file */
		keyData: null,                      /* Key file contents */
		address: 'feedback.push.apple.com', /* feedback address */
		port: 2196,                         /* feedback port */
		feedback: false,                    /* enable feedback service, set to callback */
		interval: 3600                      /* interval in seconds to connect to feedback service */
	};

	var feedback = new apns.Feedback(options);

## Converting your APNs Certificate

After requesting the certificate from Apple export your private key as a .p12 file and download the .cer file from the iOS Provisioning Portal.

Now in the directory containing cert.cer and key.p12 execute the following commands to generate your .pem files:

	$ openssl x509 -in cert.cer -inform DER -outform PEM -out cert.pem
	$ openssl pkcs12 -in key.p12 -out key.pem -nodes
	
If you are using a development certificate you may wish to name them differently to enable fast switching between development and production. The filenames are configurable within the module options, so feel free to name them something more appropriate.

* Fixes a regression from v1.1.5 causing connections to stall and messages to not be sent.

1.1.5:

* Feature: Certificate and Key data can be passed directly when creating a new connection instead of providing a file name on disk. (See: `certData` and `keyData` options)
* Deliver whole write buffer if the socket is ready.
* Fixed some global memory leaks.
* Tidied up some code formatting glitches flagged by jslint
* Fixes #16, #17, #18, #19, #20

1.1.4:

* Fixes #15: Sending unified emoji via apn; Added encoding parameter when sending notification

1.1.3:

* Fixes #11,#12,#13,#14: Ensure delivery of notifications to Apple even under heavy load.

1.1.2:

* Fixes #9, Addresses an issue if the socket disconnects with queued notifications it would be reinitialised before its teardown is completed leaving the system in an undefined state.

1.1.1:

* Fixes issue #6 where a socket emitting an error could bring down the whole node instance as the exception is uncaught.

1.1.0:

* First shot at node-0.4.0 compatibility with new tls API.
* Fixed a bug with parsing device token which could cause an out-of-bounds error.

1.0.4:

* The 1.0.x tree is now a maintenance branch as the TLS API used has been deprecated as of node 0.4.0
* Changed package.json to specify the inoperability of this version with node > 0.4.0

1.0.3:

* Fixes a typo in the documentation in this very file

1.0.2:

* Fixes critical issue with error callback not firing (Issue #1)

1.0.1:

* Moved some object methods into the prototype to save memory
* Tidied up some connecting code
* Introduced an `index.js` to make module loading tidier
* Fixed a couple of typos. 

1.0.0: 
 
* Well I created a module; Version 0.0.0 had no code, and now it does, and it works, so that's pretty neat, right?
