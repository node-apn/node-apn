## Features

- Based on HTTP/2 based provider API
- Maintains a connection to the server to maximise notification batching and throughput.
- Automatically resends unsent notifications if an error occurs

## Installation

[npm][] is the preferred installation method:

  $ npm install apn

## Quick Start

This readme is a brief introduction, please refer to the full [documentation](doc/apn.markdown) in `doc/` for more details.

If you have previously used v1.x and wish to learn more about what's changed in v2.0, please see [What's New](doc/whats-new.markdown)

### Load in the module

```javascript
var apn = require('apn');
```

### Connecting
Create a new connection to the Apple Push Notification provider API, passing a dictionary of options to the constructor. You must supply your token credentials in the options.

```javascript
var options = {
  token: {
    key: "path/to/APNsAuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8",
    keyId: "key-id",
    teamId: "developer-team-id"
  },
  production: false
};

var apnProvider = new apn.Provider(options);
```

By default, the provider will connect to the sandbox unless the environment variable `NODE_ENV=production` is set.

For more information about configuration options consult the [provider documentation](doc/provider.markdown).

Help with preparing the key and certificate files for connection can be found in the [wiki][certificateWiki]

### Sending a notification
To send a notification you will first need a device token from your app as a string

```javascript
let deviceToken = "a9d0ed10e9cfd022a61cb08753f49c5a0b0dfb383697bf9f9d750a1003da19c7"
```

Create a notification object, configuring it with the relevant parameters (See the [notification documentation](doc/notification.markdown) for more details.)

```javascript
var note = new apn.Notification();

note.expiry = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 3600; // Expires 1 hour from now.
note.badge = 3;
note.sound = "ping.aiff";
note.alert = "\uD83D\uDCE7 \u2709 You have a new message";
note.payload = {'messageFrom': 'John Appleseed'};
note.topic = "<your-app-bundle-id>";
```

Send the notification to the API with `send`, which returns a promise.

```javascript
apnProvider.send(note, deviceToken).then( (result) => {
  // see documentation for an explanation of result
});
```

This will result in the the following notification payload being sent to the device

```json
{"messageFrom":"John Appelseed","aps":{"badge":3,"sound":"ping.aiff","alert":"\uD83D\uDCE7 \u2709 You have a new message"}}
```

You should only create one `Provider` per-process for each certificate/key pair you have. You do not need to create a new `Provider` for each notification. If you are only sending notifications to one app then there is no need for more than one `Provider`. 

If you are constantly creating `Provider` instances in your app, make sure to call `Provider.shutdown()` when you are done with each provider to release its resources and memory.

## Troubleshooting

You are encouraged to read the extremely informative [Troubleshooting Push Notifications][tn2265] Tech Note in the first instance, in case your query is answered there.

## Support

If you have any questions or difficulties working with the module, the [node-apn Google group][googlegroup] should be your first port of call.

Please include as much detail as possible - especially debug logs. If the problem is reproducible, sample code is also extremely helpful. GitHub Issues should only be created for verified problems and enhancements, this will allow them to be tracked more easily.
